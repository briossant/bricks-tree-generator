# bricks-tree-generator


<p><a href="https://briossant.com/trees/">LIVE VERSION </a></p>
<p>This project was made for 2nd  <a href={"https://threejs-journey.com/"}>Threejs-journey</a> contest, the theme was "Lego".</p>
<p>The goal of the project was to recreate my old <a href="https://briossant.com/3d-demo/006-tree-generator/">tree generator </a>
with more features, better performances and, of course, bricks instead of pipes.</p>
                    <p>All the 3d models are generated live using a single 2x2 brick model (except for the text).</p>
